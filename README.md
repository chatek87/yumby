yumby is a recipe keeper console application written in C#.  
I wanted to make an application that could store recipes and easily adjust ingredient quantities based upon how many servings were desired per a particular recipe.
 

features list:
* Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program  
<code> see: Menu.cs, ExitMenu.cs, et al.</code> 

* Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program  
<code> see: Recipe.cs, RecipeMenu.cs</code>

* Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application  
<code> see: RecipeMenu.cs</code>

* Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)  
<code> see: Utility.cs</code>
